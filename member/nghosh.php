He received his PhD degree from Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology (RRCAT), a Department of atomic energy unit, India, where he had also held the position of Scientist during 1998 - 2007. Subsequently, he conducted his postdoctoral research at University of Toronto, Canada. He then joined Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Kolkata, India in 2010 and is currently Professor in the Department of Physical Sciences, IISER Kolkata. He heads the Bio-optics and Nano-photonics (BioNap) group at IISER Kolkata. Prof. Ghosh has made several key contributions in the forefront areas of plasmonics, nano-optics, polarization optics and biophotonics. He has authored more than seventy five papers in peer-reviewed international journals, which have received over three thousand citations with h-index of  twenty eight. He has also written several invited reviews, book chapters and text book in the area of optics and photonics.
