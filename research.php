        We frequently use the centralised lithography facility to fabricate
        nanostructures showing interesting spin-optical effects and polarization-dependant spectral
        modifications. In collaboration with Dr. Partha Mitra and his lab, we prepare the substrate, draw the
        pattern on the substrate surface coated e-beam resist and subsequently, deposit the desired metal
        or dielectric on top the pattern. In-home nano-fabrication makes the ongoing research to be more
        feasible in time.

        Weak Value amplification got considerable attention, specifically, in the domain of classical optics
        since last two decades, to amplify and detect tiny optical effects. In our lab, we explore the
        fundamental philosophy of post-selection aided weak measurement phenomena as well as the
        application of weak value amplification to study tiny spin-optical effects.

      Polarization is measured using the four Stokes vector elements. 
      However, this involves multiple intensity measurements that are not suitable for probing fast 
      dynamical processes. The concept of geometric phase and the associated spin-orbit interaction of 
      light provides a novel route for this purpose. A Gaussian beam with spatially varying polarization 
      propagating along
      z-direction of a homogeneous anisotropic medium acquires a spatially varying Pancharatnam Berry 
      geometric phase.If the transmitted spatially varying polarized light beam is made to interfere 
      with a linearly polarized reference beam, the information on the polarization ellipticity and 
      the orientation of the polarization ellipse will also be encoded in the spatially varying 
      contrast of the interference.

        The orbit-orbit interaction of light leads to fundamentally rich optical phenomena whose 
        experimental exploration and theoretical understanding remain challenging. The optical vortex 
        beams undergo shifts independent of the incident state of polarization. The orbital Hall effect 
        of light can be observed using a randomly and radially polarized LG beam when it is partially 
        reflected from an air-glass interface.  The angular momentum is conserved in these cases.

      <div class="col-sm padding-0">
        Metasurfaces are two-dimensional plasmonic arrays with sub-wavelength periodicity. The conventional 
        methods used to generate OAM carrying beams include forked holograms, spatial light modulators, 
        spiral phase plates, cylindrical and axicon lenses, etc. Metasurfaces, being composed of 
        subwavelength-spaced birefringent phase-shifters, are the only optical materials to allow such 
        continuous spatial variation of phase shifts, birefringence, and orientation angle of the fast axis, 
        all of which can be controlled. It works on the principle of space-variant Pancharatnam-Berry phase 
        optical elements. Not only have they generated vortices, but they have also been able to provide 
        additional designs to produce integral, fractional, quasi focusing, and quasi non-diffracting vortex 
        beams, by varying the widths of the rings in the azimuthal or radial direction.
